# Ucb_Stat154_Project2
This is a project about clouds exploration in Arctic finished by Yang Xiang and Zhihua Zhang

During finishing this project, we refer to different resources like R document "trainControl", "trainModelList$", etc for help.
To proceed our project, we first read the reference paper carefully, exchange views and try to reach accordance. Because the data is cleaned, we then begin to do visualization and EDA. By simply plotting the well-labeled map according to expert labels(including the uncertain data), we observe the existence of spatial dependency, which indicates data is non i.i.d here. In view of this, instead of splitting data randomly, we do block-sampling to divide. To be specific, it includes partitioning data into blocks to remain dependency and then doing random sampling. The size of block is the key parameter to consider. After that, we check the performance of trivial classifier by assigning all the validation and test data to label -1, and find out the problem at hand is non trivial. As we need good features to obtain higher accuracy, we then select three best features through quantitative and visual justification like calculating the correlation and making plot based on every features. Finally we decide to use $NDAI$, $SD$ and $CORR$. Moreover, we all know CV is a terrific way to evaluate our model, and a customized generic could do us a lot of favor. We then design our own CV function which can fit many models like lda, qda, logistic regression and svm, and reports final and individual fold accuracy. Thus, we finish all the preparation before starting to train our models.
